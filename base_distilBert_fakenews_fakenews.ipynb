They are only one of 9 refugee contractors who make money off of each refugee they bring in. The program was started by Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden 35 years ago. It has exploded to be an industry whereby the agency gets paid per refugee so it makes sense for them to try and make the feds take in more and more of these people.THE BIGGER PROBLEM: The taxpayer pays for all of the  goodies  the refugee gets so World Relief never covers the education, healthcare and many other things that YOU end up paying for!!!The CEO of World Relief and most other agencies all receive a six figure income .YOUR MONEY! SCOTT ARBEITER, WORLD RELIEF S CEO, MAKES $200,000 A YEAR! Arbeiter was on Tucker Carlson tonight trying to explain away how it s ok to take tax dollars from Americans:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lfCv0eQX6cANN CORCORAN OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WATCH:In September, World Relief settled 1,400 refugees through churches and its 26 offices across the country. In the past year, the organization has worked with 9,759 refugees, the largest number of refugees to go through its office since 1999, according to Christianity Today, having partnered with 1,180 congregations.World Relief is one of nine organizations authorized by the federal government to help resettle refugees. Others include Church World Service, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), Episcopal Migration Ministries, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.I laughed at the use of the word  authorized  as if WR only had to get an authorization (a stamp of approval) and then was completely operating with Christian  charity  instead of mostly federal tax dollars. This is how they spin the lazy media, never mentioning that this is a business a business that could not function without your money!Incidentally, it is World Relief (a member in good standing of the Christian LEFT) that sent around a memo to staff over a year ago to tell them to not give out any R & P Abstracts for any of you calling looking for the plan for your local community.Checking the most recent Form 990 for World Relief we see that they had a total gift/grants income of $58,487,081 and $42,589,050 was provided by you, the US taxpayer, making their federally-funded share of their budget 73% taxpayer funded.I went back 6 years and their income from you jumped about $11.5 million over that time. That of course correlates with the fact that they placed more refugees into your towns each year and since they are paid by the head, that makes sense.Here is a screen shot of page 9 (this info. is usually on page 9) of World Relief s most recent 990. You can find several years of WR s 990 s here if you want to have a deeper look into their finances. All IRS 501(c)3 organizations are required to make their financial information public, so remember that if you are trying to get Form 990s for a local group.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the sale of mobile artillery rocket systems to Romania worth up to $1.25 billion, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday. The Pentagon agency said it notified Congress of the possible sale on Thursday. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the weapons system. Romania has asked for up to 54 high mobility artillery rocket systems and related services and equipment, the agency said in a statement. \",\n          \"With all the recent talk of sentencing reform and unfair bail across America, sometimes what it takes is an outrageous case in a small town somewhere to light a fire under activists to demand a change. And even though the resignation of a judge in Pearl, Mississippi, a suburb of the capital with a meager 25,000 residents, isn t really anyone s idea of a revolution, it probably means a lot to the mother at the center of the case.Judge John Shirley of the now-dissolved Pearl Youth Court decided back in August of 2016 that some unpaid court fees were enough to separate  Mother A,  a resident of nearby Jackson, from her baby for a period of 14 months. The unidentified mom and a friend were driving through Pearl one day looking for work when they were pulled over by a police officer who discovered that both women had misdemeanor warrants for minor offenses.Honestly, the story begins with that officer, who is also unidentified in the report from the Clarion-Ledger, the news outlet that first reported the judge s resignation. So much begins with a cop s interaction with a young person   will they detain them? Will they give them a warning? Initial contact with law enforcement often determines the course of a young person s life, and most police are totally aware of that fact. Mother A  had her baby with her that day, and although the woman s grandmother came to the scene immediately to collect the baby, that officer decided to change the young woman s life by requiring her to bring the child before the Pearl Youth Court.If it seems like I m being too hard on the cop, let me assure you, I ve saved most of my hate for Judge Shirley. How an arbiter of justice thinks ordering a young mother to stay away from her newborn baby is anything approaching justice is bewildering to me. But that s just what Judge Shirley did, remanding the infant to the custody of the grandmother and imposing a goddamn NO CONTACT ORDER between Mother A and her baby until the poor (as in, without money) young woman could pay off her court fees.Not only could she not see her child, she couldn t see her grandmother while the baby was present. It was just to be cruel. That s the only explanation.Cliff Johnson, the Director of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, agreed. As a civil rights lawyer in Mississippi, I am no stranger to injustice, but for a judge to prohibit an impoverished mother from having any contact with her baby until monetary payments are made is shocking and repugnant. Such orders are tantamount to judicial kidnapping. Between two people   one cop and one judge   a young woman s life is forever changed, her idea of justice forever skewed, her trust in authority forever hobbled by the fear of a cruelty that exists only for its own sake.Featured image via judgejohnshirley.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They control their uninformed base through fear. If you re a Republican, it s because you re afraid. Afraid someone will take your paycheck and give it to someone who chooses not to work. Afraid that the economy is about to crash because  teenagers  working for minimum wage might get a raise. Afraid that ISIS lives in your neighborhood, that the Obama administration put them there and any minute now they ll be pounding on your door to take away your guns.The fear is, quite simply, ridiculous. Terrorists rule through fear. They use it to control people. Is it really any wonder that when some right-winger goes nutty and starts shooting people indiscriminately that we call them terrorists? They are born of the party of fear.The latest sleazy tactic of Republicans comes from their fundraising committee. Rather than send out the kinds of mailers that you may see from the DNC that tell a story and ask for a donation, the RNC is sending out a fundraiser that looks like a bill, obviously aimed at swindling the elderly and uninformed. The mailer comes in an envelope with a giant red  NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY  on the front. Inside, the chairman of the RNC himself notifies the addressee that they have  funds  past due and if they know what s good for them they ll pay.It s a tactic that may be legal; that doesn t make it any less despicable. For Reince Priebus to allow his name to be printed on the bottom of this trash right along with hiss signature proves that the GOP cares only about the money. Rachel Maddow does a great job of exposing this travesty, which was sent to her watchdog site, sendittorachel.com, by a concerned citizen.

Republicans even gained dominance over state legislatures in Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and several others   all thanks to deviously drawn voting districts that weaken the impact of Democratic voters while giving a total advantage to the GOP.Twelve years ago, the Supreme Court had difficulty deciding whether districts in Pennsylvania had been gerrymandered or not, leading Justice Anthony Kennedy to throw his hands up in frustration that the Court could not grant relief to those who were screwed over by conniving lawmakers. But he did call for seeking a remedy that would nail lawmakers to the wall for gerrymandering. And now Wisconsin Republicans and Republicans across the nation are panicking because a pair of academic scholars have finally found a solution and it all has to do with the nemesis of conservatives everywhere: math.According to ThinkProgress:In a paper published in the University of Chicago Law Review last year, law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos and political scientist Eric McGhee propose a mathematical formula judges can use to identify suspect maps  an objective test that can be used by judges across the country to sort suspect maps from permissible ones. A hundred different judges can examine the same maps and, provided that they are all skilled at arithmetic, all reach identical conclusions about which maps fall within an acceptable range and which ones should be presumed to be unconstitutional.In other words, Republicans are f*cked if the Supreme Court adopts the formula to make rulings in gerrymandering cases.Wisconsin Republicans have launched legal attacks against the formula, but a three judge panel that includes two Republican-appointed judges have dismissed attempts by GOP lawyers to have the case killed before a full trial proceeds.If the formula is successfully adopted by the judicial branch as the standard of determining if lawmakers unfairly drew gerrymandered districts, it could mark a critical turning point that gives Democrats a chance to compete fairly in red states again, and that could devastate the Republican Party for many elections to conservative lawmakers will have to learn how to campaign competitively instead of relying on cheating to win.

What about a federal investigation into her reckless actions that were clearly motivated by her desire to side with the rioters?? Are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?Baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after April s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. Many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  Fox News  Leland Vittert reported on  Hannity  Monday. There s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  Vittert added. Vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. The area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to Vittert. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, Fox reported.  So this was your life savings you put into this?  Vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. Exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. He added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. Vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  There were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  Vittert said. And, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. It s only property.  Business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.Via: BizPacReview\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

will they give them a warning? initial contact with law enforcement often determines the course of a young person s life, and most police are totally aware of that fact. mother a  had her baby with her that day, and although the woman s grandmother came to the scene immediately to collect the baby, that officer decided to change the young woman s life by requiring her to bring the child before the pearl youth court.if it seems like i m being too hard on the cop, let me assure you, i ve saved most of my hate for judge shirley. how an arbiter of justice thinks ordering a young mother to stay away from her newborn baby is anything approaching justice is bewildering to me. but that s just what judge shirley did, remanding the infant to the custody of the grandmother and imposing a goddamn no contact order between mother a and her baby until the poor (as in, without money) young woman could pay off her court fees.not only could she not see her child, she couldn t see her grandmother while the baby was present. it was just to be cruel. that s the only explanation.cliff johnson, the director of the roderick and solange macarthur justice center at the university of mississippi school of law, agreed. as a civil rights lawyer in mississippi, i am no stranger to injustice, but for a judge to prohibit an impoverished mother from having any contact with her baby until monetary payments are made is shocking and repugnant. such orders are tantamount to judicial kidnapping. between two people   one cop and one judge   a young woman s life is forever changed, her idea of justice forever skewed, her trust in authority forever hobbled by the fear of a cruelty that exists only for its own sake.featured image via judgejohnshirley.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after april s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  fox news  leland vittert reported on  hannity  monday. there s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  vittert added. vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. the area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to vittert. maryland gov. larry hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, fox reported.  so this was your life savings you put into this?  vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. he added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  there were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  vittert said. and, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. it s only property.  business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.via: bizpacreview\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
